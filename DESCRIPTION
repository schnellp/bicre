Description: Uses Bayesian data augmentation to fit a proportional hazards
    Poisson model for recurrent events which are observed as censored event
    counts within intervals which may overlap. A Weibull baseline hazard is
    used, with piecewise constant time-varying covariates allowed.
    Gamma-distributed frailty random effects are available.
